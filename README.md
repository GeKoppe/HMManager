This repository is a work in progress. The author gives no guarantee, that the code works.

# Introduction
This is the repository for the manager application of HMDMS, a homemade document management system.

I started this project as a means of learning to properly code in Java, as well as building a custom document management system for my private documents. It is not made to be sold or to be heavily customisable, I am building this for myself. If you want to use the code, feel free to do anything with it that is allowed under the License this repository is licensed under.

As this is a learning project, pull requests will not be accepted (for now at least), as it would limit my own learning experience. Once the software reaches it's first version, I might start accepting pull requests. Giving me tips on what I could do different or better are always appreciated though :)

There will be more documentation for the project added over time.
