# Introduction
This is the repository for the manager application of HMDMS, a homemade document management system.

I started this project as a means of learning to properly code in Java, as well as building a custom document management system for my private documents. It is not made to be sold or to be heavily customisable, I am building this for myself. If you want to use the code, feel free to do anything with it that is allowed under the License this repository is licensed under.
